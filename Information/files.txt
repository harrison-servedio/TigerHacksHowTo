All of our files are generally stored in the google drive on the 
official tigerhacks account, gcdscs.tigerhacks@gmail.com

The questions for previous years are in the drive, but coded slns
for those years are in the following github repos:

https://github.com/harrison-servedio/tigerHacks-2023

https://github.com/harrison-servedio/tigerhacks-2024

We'd recommend hosting this repos in the github account associated with
gcdscs.tigerhacks@gmail.com (the credentials for this are in the drive, as well)
for future competitions.
